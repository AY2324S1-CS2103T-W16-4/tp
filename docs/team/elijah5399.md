### Project: FriendBook

FriendBook - is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FriendBook can get your plans management done faster than traditional GUI apps.
